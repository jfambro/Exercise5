#Exercise
#1.Changing the variable name
name = 'Zed A. Shaw'
age = 35 # not a lie in 2009
height = 74 # inches
weight = 180 # lbs
eyes = 'Blue'
teeth = 'White'
hair = 'Brown'

puts "Let's talk about #{name}."
puts "He's #{height} inches tall."
puts "He's #{weight} pounds heavy."
puts "Actually that's not too heavy."
puts "He's got #{eyes} eyes and #{my_hair} hair."
puts "His teeth are usually #{teeth} depending on the coffee"

#this line is tricky, try to get it exactly right
puts "If I add #{age}, #{height}, add #{weight} I get #{age + height + weight}."

#2.Create variables and convert inches to centimeter & pounds to kilograms
centimeter = height * 2.54
kilogram =  weight / 2.2

puts "His height in centimeters is #{centimeter}"
puts "His weight in kilograms is #{kilogram}"
